# get_out.sketchplugin
A sketch plugin for getting your layers out of their artboard.

When you use sketch for drawing workflows, it's trouble to draw lines across artboards. Beacuse it will cut the line and show the only part inside the artboard. To solve this, the common way is to drag the layer out of its artboard. unfortunately, it will cause a nightmare when you have serval artboards and layers, where you have to drag your layer across a long distance to the top of the artboards stack. 

Now this plugin will help you do this dirty work. All you need to do is selecting layers you want then click hot key.
